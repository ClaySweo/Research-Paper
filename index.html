    <h2 class="green">GeForce 256</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>NVIDIA started their journey in the industry of graphics cards just before the turn of the century. On October 11, 1999. Nvidia released the first version of their <i>GeForce 256</i>, which significantly outperformed graphics chips that had been made in the past. This was marketed to consumers as the first full GPU, as it contained all of the engines and components to process over 10 million polygons a second. Modern graphics cards can perform at much higher levels than this, but none can replicate the impact this GPU had on the computing industry. Video games and computers graphics are limited by the lack of processing power in their time, so when something this monumental was released, great improvement is bound to be made.</p>
    <p>The burden of tasks like video gaming on the system was so great that they could not be done efficiently without a dedicated piece of hardware. This is where the <i>GeForce 256</i> fit into its place, as it sped up these processes by 50% or more. Despite this performance boost, the <i>GeForce 256</i> underperformed compared to its competitors when using a higher end or higher performance CPU. This was one of the main criticisms for "the first ever graphics processing unit" as its high price did not justify the subpar performance on high quality CPUs. Very little support existed for the <i>GeForce 256</i> when it came out, so much of the performance was unusable in application; the GPU could not even be installed in most motherboards on release day.</p>

    <h2 class="green2">Intel 4004</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Although a GPU is vital to any demanding process on a computer today, the first GPU was significantly predated by the first CPU. The CPU does most of the non-graphical calculations on a computer, causing it to be used at almost all times; this is why the first CPU was released much before the first GPU. This first CPU, the <i>Intel 4004</i>, was put onto the market on November 15, 1971, which was around 50 years ago. Microprocessors had existed before the <i>Intel 4004</i>, but none were put into the commercial market for various reasons, such as price or size. These tiny processors utilized a silicon gate architecture to perform calculations at blazing fast speeds.
         Much of the development for the <i>Intel 4004</i> was credited to Federico Faggin, who created the project behind the engineering of the chip.
         Every other processor before the <i>Intel 4004</i> was not a real CPU, since all of them had different parts and mechanisms happening outside of the center chip. On its release, the CPU was used only in a specific type of calculator and a pinball game. Despite this, the <i>Intel 4004</i> was considered to be used in the Pioneer 10 spacecraft, which was used to leave the solar system. The engineers for this craft did not deny the CPU for any problems with its hardware, but because it was too new at the time to be completely trusted. As is common with computer parts that are as revolutionary as this one, the pricing was too much for most consumers to justify the use cases.
         The <i>Intel 4004</i> will still go down as important history of the computer as it led to many important advancements for the future.</p>
